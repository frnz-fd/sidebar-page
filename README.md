# React + Vite

The responsive sidebar on the page fetches data from the dummyjson API and is right-aligned per mentor preferences, mirroring the style of the sample site: https://preview.themeforest.net/item/orken-consulting-and-corporate-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/49876803?_ga=2.212469399.2007509480.1702962492-369116992.1699180924. In future stages, search and filtering options will be added, improving user experience by enabling more accurate and faster access to relevant content.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
